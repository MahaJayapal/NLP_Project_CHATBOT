Fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) with LangChain and Pinecone for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Overview
This project demonstrates how to load and fine-tune a large language model (LLM) using Hugging Face's transformers library, Pinecone for vector-based search, and LangChain for orchestration. The model performs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where it generates answers to questions by retrieving relevant text chunks from a vector store and using the LLM to generate responses.

Key Components
1.	Hugging Face Transformers: A popular library for working with pre-trained language models. We load a Llama-2 model for causal language generation tasks.
2.	LangChain: A framework that simplifies the integration of language models with other components, such as vector stores and retrievers.
3.	Pinecone: A scalable vector search engine that enables efficient retrieval of relevant information from stored embeddings.
4.	Quantization: We leverage the bitsandbytes library to reduce GPU memory usage by loading the LLM in 4-bit quantized mode.

Setup and Installation

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

•	torch: For loading and working with deep learning models.
•	transformers: For loading pre-trained Hugging Face models.
•	sentence-transformers: For embedding generation.
•	pinecone-client: For connecting to Pinecone.
•	datasets, accelerate, einops, langchain: For additional utilities.
•	bitsandbytes: For quantization to save memory.

Key Components in the Code
1.	Loading Pre-trained Models:
o	We load the pre-trained Llama-2-13b-chat-hf model from Hugging Face, using quantization (4-bit mode) to reduce memory usage, making it possible to run the large model on available GPU resources.
2.	Embedding Model:
o	We use a sentence-transformers model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to generate embeddings for the text, which will later be stored in Pinecone.
3.	Vector Storage with Pinecone:
o	Pinecone is initialized, and if the index does not exist, it is created. Text data is converted into embeddings and stored in the index.
4.	Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):
o	The HuggingFacePipeline is used to integrate the LLM into a pipeline that can generate answers. LangChain's RetrievalQA class orchestrates the retrieval of relevant information from the Pinecone vector store and generates a response using the LLM.
5.	Querying the Model:
o	A query is passed to the RAG pipeline, which searches for relevant documents in the vector store and generates an answer using the LLM.


Code Walkthrough
1.	Environment Setup:
o	The code sets up the environment by checking GPU availability and initializing the Pinecone API.
2.	Model Loading:
o	The pre-trained Llama-2 model is loaded in 4-bit quantized mode to optimize GPU memory usage. The model is set to evaluation mode.
3.	Tokenization:
o	A tokenizer is loaded, which will be used for text generation tasks.
4.	Embedding Generation and Vector Store Initialization:
o	A sentence transformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) is used to create embeddings for the text, which are stored in a Pinecone index. This index can later be used for retrieval-based queries.
5.	Vector Search:
o	After setting up the vector store, the code performs a similarity search on Pinecone to retrieve the top 3 most relevant chunks of text related to a given query.
6.	Pipeline Setup:
o	LangChain's HuggingFacePipeline wraps the LLM model to generate answers based on retrieved data from Pinecone.
o	The final step is to create a RetrievalQA object, which orchestrates the retrieval and generation process.
